ProxDe
======

A proxy detection tool without an IP range filter

IMPORTANT:
------
Before I get into the features, there's something important that has to be said about this tool.
This only detects SOME proxies (because many don't have the required headers exposed) so consider this as a layer of protection. At the moment, it's impossible to detect all proxies.
Thanks for reading. :)

Features:
------
&bull; Cloudflare support
&bull; An array of proxy headers to detect (see what I did there?)
&bull; Easy to use
&bull; Ability to modify to your likings or needs
&bull; Use it in your projects and / or site(s)!
