ProxDe
======

A proxy detection tool without an IP range filter

IMPORTANT:
------
Before I get into the other stuff, there's something important that has to be said about this tool.
<br>
This only detects SOME proxies (because many don't have the required headers exposed) so consider this as a layer of protection. At the moment, it's impossible to detect all proxies.
<br>
